            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>Our idea for our project stems from a recent push in the right to repair market. Companies like Apple, Microsoft, and various laptop manufacturers have been under scrutiny recently, and other companies have been popping up, such as Framework, with right to repair in mind from the beginning. Our groups goal is to create a web application that will serve as a marketplace for users to locate various different parts they can purchase to fix their machines and products. We will integrate the Stripe API to allow easy checkout for users, as well as any easy integration experience for developers.</p>
